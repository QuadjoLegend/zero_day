MARKDOWNS
# This readme file highlights some of the key features in this repository

Line breaks - We do not support Markdown's typical double-space to generate a line break due to our built-in auto-linebreaking function. A regular line break will generate a line break on output.
Preformatted - Begin each line with two spaces or more to make text look exactly like you type it
Code - 'This is code'
Code block - ~~~~ This is a piece of code in a block ~~~~       '''This too'''
